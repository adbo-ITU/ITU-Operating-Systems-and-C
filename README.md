# ITU-Operating-Systems-and-C

My solutions to exercises, assignments, and the exam for the Operating Systems and C course at ITU (5th semester of Software Development B.Sc.)

- `22-Lab1-datalab` contains "Data Lab" - an assignment about bitwise operators. It's a git submodule, but I've copied the relevant file (`bits.c`) into the root.
- `22-Lab2-attacklab` contains "Attack Lab" - an assignment about exploiting buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code.
- `22-Lab3-malloclab` contains "Malloc Lab" - an assignment about implementing a dynamic memory allocator from scratch.
